We are grateful to the 16 reviewers for their valuable evaluations,
comments and feedback, and to the proofreaders for their thorough
work. Without their help, this book would not exist.

We also would like to thank the COST program of the European Union for
its support for the PARSEME Action, which created a dynamic environment
leading to fruitful discussions around the topics addressed in this
book.
